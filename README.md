# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Overview:
###### The purpose of this project is to build a neural network model that will predict whether applicants will be successful if they receive investment funds from the AlphabetSoup foundation. 
###### Data from past applicants, who were funded by AlphabetSoup, is used with the keras sequential model to help predict whether future applicants will be successful or not. The initial model is also tweaked for optimization to improve the accuracy of the predictions. 

### Results:
#### Data Preprocessing:
###### The data was preprocessed for the model by dropping irrelevant columns, binning categorical data into fewer categories, using OneHotEncoder to encode the categorical data, and splitting the resulting dataset into training and testing data. 
- Target Variable for model: ‘IS_SUCCESSFUL’
- Feature Variables for model: ‘APPLICATION_TYPE’, ‘AFFILIATION’, ‘CLASSIFICATION’, ‘USE_CASE’, ‘ORGANIZATION’, ‘STATUS’, ‘INCOME_AMT’, ‘SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS’, ‘ASK_AMT’
- Irrelevant Variables: ‘EIN’, ‘NAME’ 
#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
